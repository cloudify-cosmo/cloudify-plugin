	<p>The ID of the credentials entry that contains the API key.</p>
	<p>This parameter is optional; the API key may also be provided through "API options", however this method is preferred.</p>
	<p>If provided, then this credentials entry must either be of type "text" or "file". In the latter case, the file is read as-is and the resultant string is used as the API credentials.</p>
